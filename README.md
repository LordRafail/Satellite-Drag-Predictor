These are all the files one needs to have in order to run the satellite drag prediction Monte-Carlo simulation. 
The files named: coeff_CLL, coeff_DRIA, accom_SESAM, environment, are files taken from ADB-SAT, and not my own work. 
They each have their authors attributed in the file itself.

The rest of the files are my own work. 
You also need to go on to https://swe_bgs_ac_uk.content.swe.s2p.esa.int/indices.shtml?index=apforecast72hr, create an account with ESA, 
and download the .Json file with the 72hr AP index forecast and put it in the working directory. If you don't do this predicting the drag for a future date will not work.
